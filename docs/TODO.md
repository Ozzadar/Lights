# Evolving TODO list

I'm trying to manage the entire project within GitHub, with things living alongside the source code. 
Hopefully, this will make it easier to document everything and rarely have to leave my IDE -- while also giving the flexibility
to share my work and musings with others.

  up in this bitch. Especially with the physics stuff I'm working on.
