# Brainstorming the game

The time has finally come to decide what exactly I'm going to build. This is the difficult part.

A few things I'm certain on:

1. There will be a "World". Implementation-wise, this world will be a single entity that holds the positions of all
players, NPCs, etc. I'll need a way to sculpt this world eventually but for now it will be an empty level that just contains
the PCs, floating in the abyss. 
2. The core of whatever I build should be fun <u>without</u> any upgrades. That is, the core mechanic should be functional
straight upon login.

## The Theme

When I first starting building this project, the only concept I had in mind was the word "Lights". This has not changed. 
Whatever I build, it will be built off this theme.

## Dimensionality

Seeing as the purpose of this project is to build a solid foundation upon which I can build future projects, it would behoove me
to simplify the renderer as much as possible while I focus on fleshing out the rest of the engine. That being the case,
I will be making a <u>**2D** game.</u>

## Mechanics
* I like the idea of <u>DARKNESS</u> and <u>LIGHT</u>. I don't know how I could make this the main mechanic in a multiplayer game.
  * There's the standard fare utilizing <u>FOG OF WAR</u> in some form of PvP.
  * I've been playing Helldivers lately. The idea of a creeping darkness threatening to take over the world with the only
  hope of pushing it back being coordinated efforts to bring light into it.
    * Wave shooter?
    * Tower Defense?
    * Base Builder?
* I've been a little taken by the idea of a massively multiplayer basebuilding game lately. While my thoughts center primarily around
the VR space -- a 2D basebuilder could be interesting. The main issue with this is that something clever will need to be thought up
to avoid making this into a mobile game with long build times. 
  * Not sure how to integrate the theme of "Lights" though. Maybe the community will need to work together to litter the world with
  Minecraft-like "torches" that will light up areas and prevent mobs from spawning in those areas. Maybe the "long build times" issue
  can be mitigated by tying the "time-in-light" to the ability for people to build.
  * ISSUE: how do we determine who gets to build where?
* The genre I have the most experience with are 2D platformers. Additionally, I've always thought more could be done with the Maple Story
2D Platformer MMO concept. I would prefer to avoid RPG mechanics in favour of mechanics-changing progression systems. This is
similar to how Helldivers functions (well, mostly.)
  * The minecraft torch mechanic discussed above could also work in this type of game as well.
  * It'd be interesting to have a "mario" type MMO platformer -- though I'm unsure how that would stay engaging for a long time.
  Mario games are kept engaging by continuously cycling through new levels and worlds. Sure, they introduce new mechanics occasionally
  but the game is generally designed around the core jump n' stomp.
