Human Decency License (HDL) 0.1

    Do what you want with it; just try and be a decent human being and not straight up steal everything within and make
money off it (without cutting me in). If you do make money off it, consider donating some to a charity or something.

Some portions may become private in the future if something gets productized.

I'm going to add more wacky things in here as time goes on. I'm not a lawyer, but people like their license files.

Oh, and if you reproduce or distribute this software, you must include this license file.
